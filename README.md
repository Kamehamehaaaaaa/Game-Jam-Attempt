# Game-Jam-Attempt
An attempt with a shooting game idea for a Game Jam themed infinity

**Project Description:**
In a game development learning journey, along with triumphs there are always failures that come across our path. One of them is this project which I tried to design for a Game Jam themed "Infinity" where in a spaceship can protect the planet by shooting the asteroids with limited movement around an orbit. The goal of the project is to survive for the longest.
